### **End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Pipeline**

This repository showcases the development of a comprehensive data engineering solution on the Azure platform. The project focuses on migrating data from an on-premise MySQL Server database to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, transforming data using Azure Databricks, and visualizing insights through Power BI.

**Key components and technologies:**
* Azure Data Factory for data ingestion
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for data storage
* Azure Databricks for data transformation (PySpark, Spark SQL)
* Power BI for data visualization

**Project objectives:**
* Demonstrate the capabilities of Azure services for data engineering tasks
* Build a scalable and efficient data pipeline
* Provide a foundation for advanced analytics

**Repository contents:**
* Code for data ingestion, transformation, and visualization
* Documentation on project architecture, data flow, and methodologies
* Configuration files and scripts
* Power BI report
* Project report

**Potential Conclusions:**

Depending on the analysis results, several conclusions can be drawn. The data ingestion and transformation processes may have successfully yielded high-quality data suitable for analysis. The data pipeline's efficiency and scalability in handling increased data volumes can be assessed. Furthermore, the analysis may have uncovered valuable insights capable of informing strategic business decisions. Finally, the effectiveness of the dashboard in conveying key insights to end-users can be evaluated.
